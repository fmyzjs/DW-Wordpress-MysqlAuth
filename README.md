Dokuwiki mysqlauth patch to handle wordpress auth

**WARNING !**
  * This conf is created to work with groups plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/), it won't handle default wordpress group (admin, contributor, etc…)
  * You need to create a group called “Webmaster” in groups plugin, it'll be the wiki admin
